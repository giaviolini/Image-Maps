# Image Maps and Navigation bar Practice pt 2
## What I learned/Practiced
Our next assignment delt with similar topics as before. We had to create a fake realtor website and use image maps, a header and footer, and a navigation bar. 

### Image Maps 
I used the same generator as before, this time it went alot smoother because I knew how and what I wanted to accomplish. I think if I were to do this assignment again I would add and active hover to my css, so it would help the user understand where they are clicking. I didn't know exactly what I needed to do for that before, and any examples I found where much more complicated then I thought they would be. A lot of them used java script, which is something I was not comfortable using at the time of this assignment. So, I skipped it then, but I would be something I would look into now. 

### Navigation Bar
For this nav bar I used a background color to have the hover appear in like a box. Similarly to before you want to selet the ```nav``` and the ```a``` selector in your css to get the links for your different pages.  \
ex. ```nav a:hover{background-color: #110309;}```

### Header and Footer
The heading and footer were giving a lot of trouble. I was not able to have the span the full width of the page and also not cover all the text but using ```position: absolute```. This was a solution I had found on the internet, but I could not figure out why it was not working on my website. So, for the time being, I left it as it was. 

### Inputs
For this assignmnet I also used inputs to help make the website look complete. Imputs require two attributes, a ```<input>``` tag and a ```<label>```tag. The ```<input>``` tag is where you will specify what type of input you are using.   \
Examples of them can be... a text box, date, mailto, or a radio button. The ```<input>```  will the type of input, but it also needs and ID and a name, which can all be similar. For example you can use 'text' for the type, 'lastnameID' for the id, and 'lastname' for the name. They will all need to between first ```<input>```   \
ex. ```<input type="text" id="firstname" name="firstname">```. \
The ```<label>``` will hold the title for  the input.  \
ex.```<label for="lastname">Last Name:</label>```  
*Important note, the label should go before the input when typing code  \
ex.```<label for="lastname">Last Name:</label>```  \
```<input type="text" id="firstname" name="firstname">```
